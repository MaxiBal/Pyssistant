# Pyssistant

## Hardware

The optimal setup for the pyssistant is to use a Raspberry Pi and a microphone, however, you can use this on a normal computer.  
It's not the best setup, as if you want to move the assistant, you'll have to move your computer.

## Features

Pyssistant is great in many things but it's main point purpose is to gather information.  It has full access to Wikipedia, Weather, 
translations, etc.  It can tell you a joke.

## ModMyPy

It is very easy to mod the Pyssistant.  You can simply write a command, add an event handler, and run the command.
